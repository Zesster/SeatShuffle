## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I can't drag a student onto the grid"
- Make sure you've added a **desk** to that grid cell first
- Students can only be placed on desks, not on empty cells

### "I can't drag a student from the list"
- Check if the student is already assigned (marked with ✓)
- Assigned students cannot be dragged from the list
- To reassign them, drag them from their current desk

### "My changes disappeared after refresh"
- Check if your browser is in **private/incognito mode**
- Private browsing may disable localStorage
- Try using a regular browser window

### "I want to start over"
- Click **☰** menu → **"Cancella Dati Salvati"**
- This will reset everything to default

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

Works best on:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ⚠️ Mobile browsers (works but drag-and-drop may be less smooth)
